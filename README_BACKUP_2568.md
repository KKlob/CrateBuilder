# ToDo:
 - Create simple dims form to input L x W x H and checkbox on if >300lbs
 - Write logic to handle math / decision making
 - Create component to display output
 - Create add on form to add additional 2x4s to brace inside of crate
 - Updated Board Feet based on any additional 2x4s
 - Style it to be reactive to whatever device app is open on.


 # Current State
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Base app is finished.
  - No real checks on input data
    - Sanitize inputs to ensure Fractions are input properly
    - Need to add logic for slim crates that need only 2 feet nudged towards center + no additional 3" on side heights
    - Refresh page to reset form easy

 # New Goals
  - Refactor app to be cleaner
    - main page - dims page and display
    - second page - add 2x4s page with new board feet
  - Perform Object-oriented programing
    - a crate is an object
    - clear crate when reseting app    

=======
  - Calcs all basic crate things.
  - Calc new crate for each base submission.
  - Can add additional 2x4s with one form submission.
  - Reset via refresh
  - CANNOT
    - clear forms on it's own
    - add additional 2x4s to a crate more than once. Additional submits will not update board ft.
>>>>>>> rewrite

 # New Goals
  - Refactor app to be cleaner
    - To be done at a later date
  - Perform Object-oriented programing
    - a crate is an object - DONE 
    - Need to restructure app to account for Crate object - DONE  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
